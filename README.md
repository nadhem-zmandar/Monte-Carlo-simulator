# Monte-Carlo-simulator
basic monte carlo simulator to predict the value of Pi.
The principe is to use a cercle with a radius 1.we divide the circle by 4. we have an area of Pi/4.
We generate n random point of coordinates (x,y) (0<x<1 , 0<y<1) and every time we check whether this point is in or out side the quarter circle. So the rate of the inside points would be equal to Pi/4.
